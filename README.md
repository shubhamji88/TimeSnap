# TimeSnap
Inspiration
There is history embedded in the most remote corners of the world, in abandoned civilizations, in fossils and in times long gone. The best way to learn about this planet's incredible history is through traveling time itself, and hence TimeSnap was born! One app to see what these busy highways looked like once upon a time and what creatures roamed it 1000 years ago.

# What it does
The mobile application lets the user travel time by asking them to specify year, they can then choose the part of earth/creature/civilizations they wish to explore. Once the user clicks on a particular part of the world/creature/(any other item) they are able to see more information about that. They can then choose to take a picture with the creature in SnapChat app and even view everything in Augmented Reality on the SnapChat app. The TimeSnap mobile application automatically redirects users to the Snapchat app AR experience. Also, users can know about different civilizations as they choose the specific time period. Users can know about the original and current location of that and civilization, as well as user, will get the major highlight of that civilization in comparison to others. It will bring an entertaining experience along with information to the users. It will create enthusiasm among the user to know more about our civilization and creatures.

# How we built it
1. We used kotlin to build this app, which has a local ROOM database to cache data.
2. Nasa WorldWind Android is used to show Globe and mark points on it.
3. Firebase is used as a backend database to store all data.
4. Creative kit is used for integration of app and Snapchat. Here, for every item, a custom sticker is made for every item to share the learnings with other Snapchatters and the Augmented Reality button directs to Snapchat to show the corresponding AR filter of the item.
